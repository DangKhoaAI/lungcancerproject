##  Problem Statement

Lung cancer remains one of the world’s deadliest cancers and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. In 2020, approximately **2.2 million** new cases were diagnosed, with **1.8 million** resulting in death.

A critical challenge lies in **early detection**, since symptoms in initial stages are often absent or extremely subtle—such as persistent fatigue, slight changes in voice, or finger clubbing—making them easy to overlook. Consequently, most patients are diagnosed at **advanced stages**, where five-year survival rates can drop **below 10%**, compared to **over 70%** if detected at stage I.

Modern screening techniques like **low-dose CT (LDCT)** scans have demonstrated a **20–25% reduction in mortality** among high-risk individuals by enabling earlier detection. However, barriers such as **limited access**, **low awareness**, and **patient hesitance** cause **less than 5%** of eligible populations worldwide to undergo regular screening.

> **Improving early detection remains a pressing need.**

### Research Question

Given this context, our research aims to answer the following question:

> **How can we leverage routine health and behavioral data to predict lung cancer risk early—before symptoms emerge or imaging is performed?**

##  Value Proposition and Stakeholder Benefits

### For Individuals

- **Proactive health monitoring**: By inputting their data (e.g., smoking habits, environmental exposures, symptom indicators), users can assess their risk level.
- **Empowerment to act**: Early prediction may prompt users to seek medical evaluation or adjust lifestyle choices before severe illness develops.

### For Healthcare Professionals

- **Insight into key risk drivers**: Feature importance analysis will highlight the most influential risk factors (e.g., smoking, air pollution, genetic predispositions), helping professionals prioritize interventions.
- **Prioritized care delivery**: Identifying high-risk individuals enables targeted follow-up, such as LDCT screening or specialist referrals.

### For Healthcare Systems

- **Reduced clinician workload**: A chatbot that handles initial risk assessments and provides educational support can alleviate pressure on healthcare teams.
- **Efficient preventative care**: Early detection models can help shift resources from late-stage treatment to early-stage screening, improving health outcomes and reducing cost burden.

##  Strategic Alignment

This project aligns with key priorities in **modern healthcare innovation** and **digital transformation**. Specifically, it supports the following strategic objectives:

- **Improved Public Health Outcomes**:  
  By promoting early detection of lung cancer through AI-based risk prediction, the system contributes to timely medical intervention, potentially reducing mortality and improving prognosis for high-risk individuals.

- **Healthcare Digitalization**:  
  The integration of **machine learning models**, **chatbot interfaces**, and a **web-based application** reflects the ongoing shift toward intelligent, data-driven digital health systems. The use of **open-source tools** such as Flask, Botpress, and Scikit-learn exemplifies scalable and cost-effective innovation.

- **Patient Empowerment and Engagement**:  
  The platform provides users with accessible, personalized risk assessment tools that enable self-awareness and proactive health decisions. Through **conversational AI**, individuals can explore their risk profiles, ask relevant health questions, and receive preventive guidance without needing immediate access to clinical professionals.

- **Scalability and Health System Support**:  
  The chatbot’s ability to automate initial triage and deliver basic health education alleviates strain on clinical resources, making it a valuable complement to traditional screening workflows, especially in **resource-limited or underserved settings**.
