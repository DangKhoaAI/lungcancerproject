#  Data Understanding

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is a comprehensive collection of patient information related to **lung cancer risk**. It contains **1,000 records**, each representing a unique patient, along with **26 columns** detailing:

- Demographic data  
- Lifestyle habits  
- Environmental exposures  
- Genetic predispositions  
- Clinical symptoms  
- Final diagnosis or risk level  

This dataset is specifically designed to support the analysis of potential causes and indicators of lung cancer, thereby facilitating **early risk prediction** through data science and AI techniques.

##  Data Source and Context

The dataset includes a diverse set of **health and behavioral attributes**, such as:

- **Demographics**: `Age`, `Gender`  
- **Environmental Factors**: `Air Pollution`, `Occupational Hazards`  
- **Lifestyle Behaviors**: `Alcohol Use`, `Smoking`, `Passive Smoker`, `Balanced Diet`  
- **Genetic and Chronic Conditions**: `Genetic Risk`, `Chronic Lung Disease`, `Obesity`  
- **Symptoms and Clinical Signs**: `Coughing of Blood`, `Chest Pain`, `Shortness of Breath`, `Clubbing of Finger Nails`, etc.

> According to a study published in *Nature Medicine*, air pollution can increase the risk of lung cancer even in **non-smokers**. A 6-year study of over **462,000 people** in China revealed that individuals living in high-pollution areas were more likely to develop lung cancerâ€”particularly among non-smokers and older adults.

This underscores the importance of analyzing a wide array of **non-traditional risk factors**, beyond smoking alone.
